Need to learn a bit more about how Bower works. Not completely clear, yet.
LakeScraper POC
Grabbing lake names, individual pages, and species lists.
Unfortunately, can't get a good address, or lat/lon to pinpoint them on the map.
Also, unfortunately, not all lakes listed have species lists.
Found another list at: http://itouchmap.com/?f=lake&s=IL which lists 860 lakes in Il. But doesn't give fishing info...
Fought with ko.computed() for a while... It's touchy... If you update your observableArray without using a ko function (IE: myOA()[myOA().length] = blah) then you won't get the dependencies to trigger. But if you use the ko ".push" instead, it works (IE: myOA.push(blah)).
