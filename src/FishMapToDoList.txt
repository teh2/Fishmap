Current:
--------
in the lake list, turn grey - no species, or no latlon
marker - if no species, turn marker grey
add rivers "area"



ToDos:
------
Learn more about Bower - how to keep components up to date
Learn more about Bower - how to use src/dev/dist
search function - real time, by name
gulp - build script
style up the page
make it responsive
test it in a phone browser
Add sort criteria to species dropdown (alpha, frequency, threshold)
add API calls - fishing reports
add API calls - pics, pintrest, flickr, picasa, panoramia, instagram
add API calls - wikipedia articles - link from species name in popup window?
Does the trib have an API?
Maybe the Herald?
add lat/lon (to lakes with no species)
add "Unknown" species to lakes with no species
local storage

In the infoWindow, make each species name a link to the wikipedia article on that species. Or to a corresponding page at iFishIllinois.
something else


Finished:
---------
LakeScraper proof of concept
basic html page
incorporate Bower
integrate knockout
hook up lake list
set up git repo and get the POC committed
add county info
Store info locally
Set up the map
Add pins to the map
change pin to a fish symbol
integrate bootstrap
Area filters. Got 'em checking and unchecking in the dropdown.
Got the lakes list to repopulate.
Got the markers to repopulate.
fixed - markers don't populate on startup
filter function - area - nw, ne, ec, wc, s
filter function - pick one or more species
filter function - other criteria?


Development log:
----------------
Set up initial project directories
Initial Bower configuration
Need to learn a bit more about how Bower works. Not completely clear, yet.
LakeScraper POC
Grabbing lake names, individual pages, and species lists.
Unfortunately, can't get a good address, or lat/lon to pinpoint them on the map.
Also, unfortunately, not all lakes listed have species lists.
Found another list at: http://itouchmap.com/?f=lake&s=IL which lists 860 lakes in Il. But doesn't give fishing info...
Fought with ko.computed() for a while... It's touchy... If you update your observableArray without using a ko function (IE: myOA()[myOA().length] = blah) then you won't get the dependencies to trigger. But if you use the ko ".push" instead, it works (IE: myOA.push(blah)).
rewrote it to load from a locally sourced JSON object rather than the scraper. This will make it possible to splice in latlon values, and pin the lakes up on the map.
Notes on map markers:
	Maybe I need a lakes list, and a visible lakes list...
	Or... can I filter them as they're added to the menu and the markers?
	Or... Could I set them as hidden in the list? and removed from the map?
	This last idea might just be the best... If it works.
	Currently, viewModel.lakes is observable directly by the binding in the html.
	Is there a way to compute the observable? Or something like that?
	keep it simple: use two arrays, one of all the lakes, the other of the visible lakes based on the filters. When the filters change, use removeAll, and then push the visible ones back into the array. ANd look at setting the rateLimit on the observableArray so it doesn't repaint on every push.
