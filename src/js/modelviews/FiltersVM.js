/*** FiltersVM manages the Filters Drop Down menu display.** It is very simple because almost all of the functionality of the menu is handled directly in the HTML page by knockout. The only thing that's a bit tricky here is the handling of the actual button press.**/var FiltersVM = function(inFilters) {	var self = this;	this.filters = inFilters;	//intercept button presses and stop them from propagating up the DOM tree, since they are handled directly in the page by the "data-toggle".	this.setupFiltersMenu = function() {		$('#filtersMenu .dropdown-menu li').on({			"click":function(e){				e.stopPropagation();			}		});	};};
